# MedicineQuadrupedRobot

**Medicine-Ornamental crucian carp driven quadruped multi-gait robot**  
This project is an interrogation based on whether gene editing manipulates evolution and the concretization of the question of whether evolution is nihilistic.

## Key Sentence
Just as Andy Warhol's works satirize mass capitalist consumption, can fish, acting as sensors in a mechanical system, blur the line between living beings and machines? If a goldfish is subjected to extreme genetic intervention, can it still be classified as an "animal"? This research explores whether such cultivated species exist as elements or living beings, questioning the implications of evolution and artificial selection.

## 1. Research Topics
This study investigates the integration of biological and mechanical devices following genetic intervention, focusing on domestication and nihilism. Influenced by Michael J. Sandel’s views, the findings will be presented in an exhibition.

## 2. Research Purpose
The core question examines genetic engineering's role in evolution and the significance of genetically modified "ideal organisms" in society. Using ornamental goldfish as a case study, it questions whether they are products of natural evolution or have become artificial "machines." The overlap between science and religion today raises questions about blind faith in technology.

## 3. Image Presentation
**Fish as Sensors for Controlling a Quadruped Walking Robot**  
A four-legged machine with a tank of ornamental goldfish adapts its gait—reptilian or mammalian—based on the goldfish's movement. Water mist is sprayed from the tank, with gait modes determined by water levels.

## 4. Structure of the Work
Building on prior research like the 2018 Snail King series, this project discusses the core factors that construct value in species and the effects of human intervention. The work addresses how capital-driven artificial intelligence interests influence species evolution.

## 5. Research Methods
The study employs literature review and experimental creation, collaborating with local labs to explore the intersection of biology and technology. Interactive applications will be presented, focusing on quadruped robot movement and visual recognition using ESP32 CAM and OpenCV, combined with ultrasonic nebulizers and water level sensors.

## 6. Expected Results
The project aims to initiate discussions on existentialism, mind-matter dualism, and the belief in science as a new religious system, culminating in an exhibition.

# Robot Manual

## Product Overview
Thank you for choosing our "medicine" robot. This robot is a four-legged multi-modal walking machine driven by an ornamental goldfish, combining gene editing technology and Chinese cultural aesthetics. Its main function is to control the walking mode of the robot through the movement behavior of fish and spray water mist to simulate the mechanism of progress-driven species destruction.

## Specifications
- **Dimensions**: (standby) length 30 cm × width 20 cm × height 25 cm
- **Weight**: 1.3 kg
- **Power Requirements**: Built-in rechargeable Ni-Mh battery (6V)
- **Material**: High strength plastic and metal alloy
- **Range of Movement**: Quadrupedal walking, steering
- **Sensor Type**: Water level sensor, motion detection sensor, camera
- **Processor**: ESP32, Arduino Nano

## Component Description
- **Fish Tank**: A transparent container housing ornamental carp.
- **Control Unit**: The central processor that manages the robot's movements and sensing signals.
- **Drive System**: The motor and connecting mechanism that drive the robot to move.
- **Sensor**: Electronic device used to detect water level and fish movement.

## Operation Guide
1. **Startup**:  
   - Press the power button on the bottom of the robot, and the LED light will light up to indicate successful startup.
   
2. **Control Mode**:  
   - See note A.
   
3. **Close**:  
   - Press and hold the power button for 3 seconds to turn off the robot.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Install the Fish Tank**:  
   - Ensure there is enough water in the fish tank and add ornamental carp.
   
2. **Connect Power Supply**:  
   - Use the included charger to charge the robot; the LED light will flash while charging.
   
3. **Configuration App**:  
   - Follow the instructions in the app to set up your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection.

## Troubleshooting
- **Issue**: Bot won't start  
  - **Solution**: Check if the power supply is sufficient and press the power button again.

- **Problem**: Unstable walking  
  - **Solution**: Check if the water level sensor is working properly and ensure the water level is within the appropriate range.

## Maintenance and Care
- Clean the fish tank and robot housing regularly to keep them in working condition.
- Check battery status regularly and charge as needed.
- Update the app to get the latest features and fixes.

## Safety Precautions
- Do not let the robot run without water to avoid damaging the internal circuit.
- Keep the robot away from high-temperature and humid environments.
- Monitor the health of ornamental carp and change the water regularly.
